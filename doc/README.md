The project is focus on the discussion of whether the family burden affect the individuals' participation and the result of voting. I separated the family burden into three aspects: Number of children they have, social class, working status.
Number of children: whether the number of children they have affect the participation.
                    With the same number of children, whether their gender affect.
                    whether the number of children affect their voting.
Social Class:       whether their social class affect their participation.
                    whether their social class affect their voting.
Working status:     whether their working status affect their participation
                    whether their working status affect their voting.
Any other factors due to the family burden we need to consider?
