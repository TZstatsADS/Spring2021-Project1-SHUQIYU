The project is focus on the discussion of whether the family burden affect the individuals' participation and the result of voting. I separated the family burden into three aspects: Number of children they have, social class, working status. Number of children: whether the number of children they have affect the participation. With the same number of children, whether their gender affect. whether the number of children affect their voting. Social Class: whether their social class affect their participation. whether their social class affect their voting. Working status: whether their working status affect their participation whether their working status affect their voting. Any other factors due to the family burden we need to consider?
